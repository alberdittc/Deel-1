## Achievements

Created 4 endpoints of 7. 

Note /api/v1 in the URIs

http://localhost:5001/api/v1/contracts/1 (it requires to pass contract id in the header to get auth)

http://localhost:5001/api/v1/contracts

http://localhost:5001/api/v1/jobs/unpaid

http://localhost:5001/api/v1/jobs/pending/5/pay


Note: I just added getProfile auth middleware for the first endpoint as a POC. I did not include for the rest of endpoints, in the real world probably a middleware like this would return a token (JWT) after a successful API login

I spent 5 hours and probably 2 hs thinking how to implement endpoint number 4 in a smart way to manage the transactions. Use of promises all and rollback in case of unexpected scenario.

With more time, I would have added chai, sinon, to mock the DB and do unit tests and integration tests. Happy to show personal projects with good coverage using chai or jest and sinon.

Also, a front end consuming the APIs had been very nice. Probably relying on a light weight library (Svelte maybe)

I enjoyed a lot and I learnt a bit about Sequelieze, very handy btw

Unit/integration tests should be a must. It was time consuming, if I can spare time, at any point, I will add it. happy to show projects with Sequelize mocking DB with chai and sinon

## Data Models

> **All models are defined in src/model.js**

### Profile
A profile can be either a `client` or a `contractor`. 
clients create contracts with contractors. contractor does jobs for clients and get paid.
Each profile has a balance property.

### Contract
A contract between and client and a contractor.
Contracts have 3 statuses, `new`, `in_progress`, `terminated`. contracts are considered active only when in status `in_progress`
Contracts group jobs within them.

### Job
contractor get paid for jobs by clients under a certain contract.

## Getting Set Up

  
The exercise requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed. We recommend using the LTS version.

  

1. Start by cloning this repository.

  

1. In the repo root directory, run `npm install` to gather all dependencies.

  

1. Next, `npm run seed` will seed the local SQLite database. **Warning: This will drop the database if it exists**. The database lives in a local file `database.sqlite3`.

  

1. Then run `npm start` which should start both the server and the React client.

  

❗️ **Make sure you commit all changes to the master branch!**

  
  

## Technical Notes

  

- The server is running with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) which will automatically restart for you when you modify and save a file.

- The database provider is SQLite, which will store data in a file local to your repository called `database.sqlite3`. The ORM [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) is on top of it. You should only have to interact with Sequelize - **please spend some time reading sequelize documentation before starting the exercise.**

- To authenticate users use the `getProfile` middleware that is located under src/middleware/getProfile.js. users are authenticated by passing `profile_id` in the request header. after a user is authenticated his profile will be available under `req.profile`. make sure only users that are on the contract can access their contracts.
- The server is running on port 3001.

  

## APIs To Implement 

  

Below is a list of the required API's for the application.

  


1. ***GET*** `/contracts/:id` - This API is broken 😵! it should return the contract only if it belongs to the profile calling. better fix that!

1. ***GET*** `/contracts` - Returns a list of contracts belonging to a user (client or contractor), the list should only contain non terminated contracts.

1. ***GET*** `/jobs/unpaid` -  Get all unpaid jobs for a user (***either*** a client or contractor), for ***active contracts only***.

1. ***POST*** `/jobs/:job_id/pay` - Pay for a job, a client can only pay if his balance >= the amount to pay. The amount should be moved from the client's balance to the contractor balance.

1. ***POST*** `/balances/deposit/:userId` - Deposits money into the the the balance of a client, a client can't deposit more than 25% his total of jobs to pay. (at the deposit moment)

1. ***GET*** `/admin/best-profession?start=<date>&end=<date>` - Returns the profession that earned the most money (sum of jobs paid) for any contactor that worked in the query time range.

1. ***GET*** `/admin/best-clients?start=<date>&end=<date>&limit=<integer>` - returns the clients the paid the most for jobs in the query time period. limit query parameter should be applied, default limit is 2.
